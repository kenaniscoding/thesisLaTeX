\section{User Priority Formula} \label{sec:userPriorityFormula}
\gls{not:bprio} and \gls{not:rprio} and \gls{not:sprio} are the user priorities for bruises, ripeness, and size of the Carabao mango. 
Furthermore, \gls{not:bpred} and \gls{not:rpred} and \gls{not:spred} are the machine learning's predictions for bruises, ripeness, and size of the Carabao mango.
The formula for the user priority is given by:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:userPriority}
	\text{User Priority} = \frac{b \left( P \right) + r \left( P \right) + s \left( P \right)}{3}
