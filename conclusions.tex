\section{Concluding Remarks}

In this \documentType, the prototype is successful in grading and sorting Carabao mangoes based on 
the user priority and machine learning algorithm. More specifically, the prototype is successful in
automatimcally classifying Carabao mangoes based on ripeness (Green, Green Yellow, and Yellow), 
size (Large, Medium, Small), and bruises (bruised and not bruised)

\section{Contributions}

The contributions of each group member are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item BANAL Kenan A.: Scrum Master (Project manager in charge of the hardware and software integration) 
  \item BAUTISTA Francis Robert Miguel F.: Front End Engineer (UI/UX Designer in charge of software interface 
  and hardware assistant of the Scrum Master) 
  \item HERMOSURA Don Humphrey L. : Back End Engineer (Software Engineer in charge of the 
  machine learning algorithm and software assistant of the Scrum Master)
  \item SALAZAR Daniel G.: Product Engineer (Software Engineer in charge of training and testing of 
  the machine learning algorithm)
\end{itemize}


\section{Recommendations}

The researchers recommend that the prototype be improved in the optimization of the machine learning algorithm
and the hardware design. The researchers also recommend that the prototype be tested in the 
actual grading and sorting of Carabao mangoes in the market. 

\section{Future Prospects}

Future researchers may consider the following recommendations for future work:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  User testing of the prototype in the actual grading and sorting of Carabao mangoes in the Philippine market.
	\item  Additional of weight measurement to the prototype to improve the grading and sorting of Carabao mangoes.
	\item  Integration of a custom PCB to improve the hardware design of the prototype.
\end{enumerate}
