The theoretical framework seen in figure x revolves around the concepts that revolve around the research topic. Embedded systems include the Raspberry Pi, which is the microcontroller that will be the brain of the system, DC motors, 4 channel relays, and the conveyor belt. The machine learning portion includes a neural network model, namely the Convolutional Neural Network, which will use computer vision as a method of seeing and classifying the mangoes based on their physical traits. The image processing will include methods such as size calculation and background removal using OpenCV. Lastly, the Carabao mango will be the test subject of the system.

\section{Technical Background}

At its core, the system will be using machine learning concepts pertaining to CNN and OpenCV, and may use other algorithms such as Naive Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbors to supplement the classification tasks, particularly for assessing mango ripeness, bruise detection, and size determination. The system will be built on an embedded framework, integrating a Raspberry Pi microcontroller to control the RaspberryPi camera, actuators, LED lights, and motors. A user-friendly GUI will also be utilized to ensure users can customize the prioritization of the mango sorting system.
