% Carabao Mangoes are one of the sweetest mangoes in the world and one
%  of the major producers of this is the Philippines.
%   However, mangoes go through many screening processes, one of them being 
%   sorting and grading during post harvesting which is labor intensive, prone
%    to human error, and can be inefficient if done manually. Previous researchers
%     have taken steps to automate the process, however, their works often focus on 
%     only specific traits, and do not try to encapsulate all the physical traits
%      of the mangoes altogether. Furthermore, previous researchers made the grading 
%      system static or unchangeable to the user. In this study, the researchers
%       will develop an automated Carabao mango grader and sorter based on ripeness, 
%       size, and bruises with an interchangeable mango attribute priority through 
%       non-destructive means. Using machine vision, image processing, Machine Learning,
%        microcontrollers and sensors the mangoes will be physically sorted into designated
%         bins via a conveyor belt system which can be controlled and monitored via a graphical
%          user interface. The approach will streamline the post-harvest process and cut down on 
%          human errors and labor costs, helping maintain the high quality of Carabao mango exports. 
% current mango sorting and grading systems have a fix sorting method which consist of either a combination of ripeness, bruises, or size
% the researchers propose a new system that will be able to sort and grade the Carabao mangoes based on the user priority and machine learning algorithm
% likewise the researches tested different machine learning algorithms for classifying ripeness and bruises.
