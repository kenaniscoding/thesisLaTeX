	abstract = {This study explores machine learning’s potential to classify carabao mangoes, a key Philippine export, into four grades based on size: A (large), B (medium), C (small), and R (reject). It introduces a Naïve Bayes classification model that uses image processing to extract features for grading. The goal is to create a consistent grading system to enhance export efficiency and benefit local farmers. The research aims to validate the Naïve Bayes model’s accuracy using size, weight, area, and spot ratio. It employs a quantitative, experimental design, manipulating image processing techniques to gauge their impact on classification accuracy. The results show the Naïve Bayes model achieved 95\% accuracy, effectively distinguishing large and reject mangoes. It performed well for medium and small mangoes, with a 7\% error rate between these classes. This indicates the model’s potential for quality control and sorting, though further refinement is needed to better differentiate between medium and small sizes. In conclusion, the study presents an image processing and Naïve Bayes-based method to classify carabao mangoes by size. The model’s high accuracy suggests its effectiveness and potential for automating mango classification, which could significantly aid the Philippine mango industry. Further performance assessment was conducted using a confusion matrix. The research highlights the promise of this approach for efficient mango grading.},

	abstract = {In order to achieve the accuracy of mango grading, a mango grading system was designed by using the deep learning method. The system mainly includes CCD camera image acquisition, image preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation. Aiming at the traditional deep learning, neural network training needs a large number of sample data sets; a convolutional neural network is proposed to realize the efficient grading of mangoes through the continuous adjustment and optimization of super-parameters and batch size. The ultra-lightweight SqueezeNet related algorithm is introduced. Compared with AlexNet and other related algorithms with the same accuracy level, it has the advantages of small model scale and fast operation speed. The experimental results show that the convolutional neural network model after super-parameters optimization and adjustment has excellent effect on deep learning image processing of small sample data set. Two hundred thirty-four Jinhuang mangoes of Panzhihua were picked in the natural environment and tested. The analysis results can meet the requirements of the agricultural industry standard of the People’s Republic of China—mango and mango grade specification. At the same time, the average accuracy rate was 97.37\%, the average error rate was 2.63\%, and the average loss value of the model was 0.44.

	abstract = {Mangoes, the king of fruits is globally exported and locally consumed on a large scale. During exports and local marketing, delivering good quality fruits and satisfying certain pre-defined standards is important. This post-harvest operation of quality checking, known as mango grading is usually performed manually. But manual grading can be in-consistent, erroneous and labor-intensive. A computer vision based grading solution will result in consistent and accurate sorting. Such a mango grading system based on external parameters namely ripeness, size, shape, defects was developed in this research work. Image processing techniques were applied to extract the color, geometric and shape related features. These features were further utilized by pre-trained random forest classifiers to determine the mango ripeness (unripe/mid-ripe/ripe), size (small/medium/large) and shape (well-formed/deformed) category. K-means clustering was applied for defect segmentation to determine the mango defect category as (non-defective/mid-defective/completely-defective). Final grading was performed using a grading formula that combines the parameter specific quality scores assigned, according to predicted categories. Ripeness, size and shape classification performed on a created dataset of Dashehari mangoes achieved a test accuracy of 100\%, 98.19\% and 99.20\% respectively. Formula based integrated grading could grade mangoes with 88.88\% accuracy.},

This study determined bruise injury in 'Carabao' fruit as affected by harvest method, dropping from heights of up to 5 m, and interaction of ripeness stage [viz. mature green (MG), more yellow than green (MYG), and fully yellow (FY)] and dropping from 0.5 m up to 1.5 m. Mangoes harvested carefully or by the conventional method consistently had better visual quality at harvest and a lower degree of anthracnose and stem-end rot at the table ripe (TR) stage than those that were dropped. As the drop height increased, cracked fruit, weight loss, and bruised flesh also increased in terms of incidence and severity. There was a positive correlation between the kinetic energy at impact and bruised flesh (y = 2.63x + 20.52, R2 = 0.26, P = 0.02). Retention of green color on the bruised skin surface was evident on mangoes dropped at the MG stage. Subtending bruised flesh was characterized by a white mass of unhydrolyzed starch. Fruit dropped at the MYG stage had soft and opaque bruised flesh. Those dropped at the FY stage had transparent jelly-like bruised flesh beneath the impact site. This study on 'Carabao' mango fruit illustrates that the extent of damage appeared throughout the ripe stage, especially if the fruit does not sustain a crack when dropped. The serial symptomology could be gainfully used in quality assessments in the supply chain to help identify the maturity stages at which these damages occur. This also highlights the importance of avoiding physical damage at harvest and when the fruit progress through ripening.},

The competitive edge of the Philippines in the global market has been recorded in the trading history. Its contribution to the economy is notable; however trading is limited to fresh mangoes. Likewise, the continuous decrease of area planted to mangoes contributed to its bounded participation in global value chain. Meanwhile, some countries in Asia emerged in the industry and further threatened the entrance of Philippine mango in the foreign market. This situation will be altered by strengthening the country’s global competitiveness, gross domestic product and implementing policies on remoteness of the country. The policy recommendations, if implemented, can guarantee strong integration of Philippine mangoes in the global chain, which will facilitate the flow of factor payments in the economy, thereby raising the standard of living of Philippine citizens and creating more social protection for the Philippine people.},

There are many varieties of mangoes, which are distinguishable on the basis of their taste, shape, colour intensity, etc. These features are utilized technically and are able to distinguish different varieties well enough. Mango is widely used in food products like jams, juices, medicines, and bakery items. The purchase of this fruit from the local market totally depends upon the human visual perception. A mistake in picking the wrong variety against the demand causes a loss in quality of that product in which it has to be used and also an international disrepute in case of exporting. Texture technique and shape extraction is broadly used for image classification. In our work, these techniques are applied on mango images for their categorization i.e. matching, extracting, object classification and for analysis. The results achieved are quite promising and proves that these techniques can be used to identify types of Mangoes and not only their sizes.},
