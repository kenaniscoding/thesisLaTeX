	abstract = {Harvested mangoes are commonly classified or sorted manually. This method is tedious, time consuming, inaccurate and prone to errors. Human inspection is also subjective and factors like visual stress and tiredness may arise that can result in the inconsistencies in judgment. The use of a chroma meter is reliable but the equipment is expensive. This study explored the use of three digital image processing algorithms to determine harvested ‘Carabao’ mango ripeness stages. Canny edge detection, Sobel edge detection, and Laplacian of Gaussian detection algorithms were used to extract a mango image from its original image. The mean red, green, and blue (RGB) values of the detected images were converted to L*a*b* color values which were used to identify the ripeness level of the mango image based on the standard generated from gathered data of ‘Carabao’ mangoes. The standard generated was also based on the mango peel color index scale from University of the Philippines Los Baños Postharvest Horticulture Training and Research Center (PHTRC). The algorithms’ performance had an overall accuracy of 80.5\% for canny edge detection algorithm and L*a*b* color extraction using neural networks; 63.88\% for Sobel edge detection algorithm and L*a*b* color extraction using rgb2lab function in MATLAB software; and 17.33\% Laplacian of Gaussian detection and L*a*b* color extraction using OpenCV. Overall, the implementation of Canny edge detection algorithm for image processing and L*a*b* color extraction using neural networks performed best among the algorithms used in classifying ‘Carabao’ mango ripeness stages. To improve the performances of the algorithms, it is recommended to improve the quality of the sample images by controlling the light, exposure, and camera to be used, matching it with more chroma meter sample points on the ‘Carabao’ mango to attain a better color average of the sample mango.},

	abstract = {This study explores machine learning’s potential to classify carabao mangoes, a key Philippine export, into four grades based on size: A (large), B (medium), C (small), and R (reject). It introduces a Naïve Bayes classification model that uses image processing to extract features for grading. The goal is to create a consistent grading system to enhance export efficiency and benefit local farmers. The research aims to validate the Naïve Bayes model’s accuracy using size, weight, area, and spot ratio. It employs a quantitative, experimental design, manipulating image processing techniques to gauge their impact on classification accuracy. The results show the Naïve Bayes model achieved 95\% accuracy, effectively distinguishing large and reject mangoes. It performed well for medium and small mangoes, with a 7\% error rate between these classes. This indicates the model’s potential for quality control and sorting, though further refinement is needed to better differentiate between medium and small sizes. In conclusion, the study presents an image processing and Naïve Bayes-based method to classify carabao mangoes by size. The model’s high accuracy suggests its effectiveness and potential for automating mango classification, which could significantly aid the Philippine mango industry. Further performance assessment was conducted using a confusion matrix. The research highlights the promise of this approach for efficient mango grading.},

	abstract = {In order to achieve the accuracy of mango grading, a mango grading system was designed by using the deep learning method. The system mainly includes CCD camera image acquisition, image preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation. Aiming at the traditional deep learning, neural network training needs a large number of sample data sets; a convolutional neural network is proposed to realize the efficient grading of mangoes through the continuous adjustment and optimization of super-parameters and batch size. The ultra-lightweight SqueezeNet related algorithm is introduced. Compared with AlexNet and other related algorithms with the same accuracy level, it has the advantages of small model scale and fast operation speed. The experimental results show that the convolutional neural network model after super-parameters optimization and adjustment has excellent effect on deep learning image processing of small sample data set. Two hundred thirty-four Jinhuang mangoes of Panzhihua were picked in the natural environment and tested. The analysis results can meet the requirements of the agricultural industry standard of the People’s Republic of China—mango and mango grade specification. At the same time, the average accuracy rate was 97.37\%, the average error rate was 2.63\%, and the average loss value of the model was 0.44.

In line with this, fruits are considered one of the country's most exported goods (3rd as of 2020). The researchers proposed a system using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to determine the fruit maturity of Banana, Mango, and Calamansi. Said fruits are classified into three categories for fruit maturity, namely: unripe, ripe, and overripe. 140 fruits were gathered and used starting when it was unripe until it was overripe. This was done in a 12-hour interval, every 9 am and 9 pm every day for two weeks. The data gathered consists of 1729 images of bananas (Cavendish), 711 images of mangos, and 589 images of calamansi. The model was written in Python, and the integrated development environment (IDE) used was a jupyter notebook. HSV Conversion, Hyperparameter tuning, and Feature Extraction were used to increase the accuracy of the model. Three models were used, namely, Model 1, the model after fitting the dataset with background and Hyperparameter Tuning, Model 2, the model after fitting the dataset with removed background and features identified, and Model 3, the model after fitting the dataset with removed background, identified features and underwent hyperparameter tuning.},

	abstract = {Mangoes, the king of fruits is globally exported and locally consumed on a large scale. During exports and local marketing, delivering good quality fruits and satisfying certain pre-defined standards is important. This post-harvest operation of quality checking, known as mango grading is usually performed manually. But manual grading can be in-consistent, erroneous and labor-intensive. A computer vision based grading solution will result in consistent and accurate sorting. Such a mango grading system based on external parameters namely ripeness, size, shape, defects was developed in this research work. Image processing techniques were applied to extract the color, geometric and shape related features. These features were further utilized by pre-trained random forest classifiers to determine the mango ripeness (unripe/mid-ripe/ripe), size (small/medium/large) and shape (well-formed/deformed) category. K-means clustering was applied for defect segmentation to determine the mango defect category as (non-defective/mid-defective/completely-defective). Final grading was performed using a grading formula that combines the parameter specific quality scores assigned, according to predicted categories. Ripeness, size and shape classification performed on a created dataset of Dashehari mangoes achieved a test accuracy of 100\%, 98.19\% and 99.20\% respectively. Formula based integrated grading could grade mangoes with 88.88\% accuracy.},

This study determined bruise injury in 'Carabao' fruit as affected by harvest method, dropping from heights of up to 5 m, and interaction of ripeness stage [viz. mature green (MG), more yellow than green (MYG), and fully yellow (FY)] and dropping from 0.5 m up to 1.5 m. Mangoes harvested carefully or by the conventional method consistently had better visual quality at harvest and a lower degree of anthracnose and stem-end rot at the table ripe (TR) stage than those that were dropped. As the drop height increased, cracked fruit, weight loss, and bruised flesh also increased in terms of incidence and severity. There was a positive correlation between the kinetic energy at impact and bruised flesh (y = 2.63x + 20.52, R2 = 0.26, P = 0.02). Retention of green color on the bruised skin surface was evident on mangoes dropped at the MG stage. Subtending bruised flesh was characterized by a white mass of unhydrolyzed starch. Fruit dropped at the MYG stage had soft and opaque bruised flesh. Those dropped at the FY stage had transparent jelly-like bruised flesh beneath the impact site. This study on 'Carabao' mango fruit illustrates that the extent of damage appeared throughout the ripe stage, especially if the fruit does not sustain a crack when dropped. The serial symptomology could be gainfully used in quality assessments in the supply chain to help identify the maturity stages at which these damages occur. This also highlights the importance of avoiding physical damage at harvest and when the fruit progress through ripening.},

The competitive edge of the Philippines in the global market has been recorded in the trading history. Its contribution to the economy is notable; however trading is limited to fresh mangoes. Likewise, the continuous decrease of area planted to mangoes contributed to its bounded participation in global value chain. Meanwhile, some countries in Asia emerged in the industry and further threatened the entrance of Philippine mango in the foreign market. This situation will be altered by strengthening the country’s global competitiveness, gross domestic product and implementing policies on remoteness of the country. The policy recommendations, if implemented, can guarantee strong integration of Philippine mangoes in the global chain, which will facilitate the flow of factor payments in the economy, thereby raising the standard of living of Philippine citizens and creating more social protection for the Philippine people.},

	abstract = {Export quality is an important component of external competitiveness on the non-cost side. First of all, quality significantly affects the global patterns of trade. Moreover, increasing the quality of existing products can strengthen existing comparative advantages while boosting export revenues. Furthermore, products with more potential for quality improvement are less exposed to low-wage competition. In this section, we analyse the determinants of export quality in the euro area. Using sectoral data on manufacturing exports for euro area countries over the period 2005-2015, we confirm the finding of a growing literature suggesting that a prime determinant of export quality is the level of income of the exporting country. Higher incomes mean domestic demand for high-quality product and go together with higher skills of the labour force and higher supply of capital. In addition, however, our results looking more in-depth at supply side channels show that the use of a higher share of high-tech inputs (both services and manufacturing products), as well as better institutions are positively related to export quality. These results are especially true for sectors with higher technological intensity, and where the potential for quality improvements is also higher. Policies to increase efficiency in product markets and to strengthen institutions therefore matter for fostering export quality and improving resilience of the economies.},

	title = {Mango {Classification} {Using} {Texture} \& {Shape} {Features}},
	volume = {18},
	abstract = {Mango is a national fruit of Pakistan and also called king of fruits. There are many varieties of mangoes, which are distinguishable on the basis of their taste, shape, colour intensity, etc. These features are utilized technically and are able to distinguish different varieties well enough. Mango is widely used in food products like jams, juices, medicines, and bakery items. The purchase of this fruit from the local market totally depends upon the human visual perception. A mistake in picking the wrong variety against the demand causes a loss in quality of that product in which it has to be used and also an international disrepute in case of exporting. Texture technique and shape extraction is broadly used for image classification. In our work, these techniques are applied on mango images for their categorization i.e. matching, extracting, object classification and for analysis. The results achieved are quite promising and proves that these techniques can be used to identify types of Mangoes and not only their sizes.},

	abstract = {Our research investigates the potential of Large-scale Language Models (LLMs), specifically OpenAI's GPT, in credit risk assessment-a binary classification task. Our findings suggest that LLMs, when directed by judiciously designed prompts and supplemented with domain-specific knowledge, can parallel the performance of traditional Machine Learning (ML) models. Intriguingly, they achieve this with significantly less data-40 times less, utilizing merely 20 data points compared to the ML's 800. LLMs particularly excel in minimizing false positives and enhancing fairness, both being vital aspects of risk analysis. While our results did not surpass those of classical ML models, they underscore the potential of LLMs in analogous tasks, laying a groundwork for future explorations into harnessing the capabilities of LLMs in diverse ML tasks.},

 Control},
  Abstract                 = {The steady state performance of a bulk transfer TCP flow
 (i.e. a flow with a large amount of data to send, such as FTP
 transfers) may be characterized by three quantities. The first
 is the send rate, which is the amount of data sent by the
 sender in unit time. The second is the throughput, which is
 the amount of data received by the receiver in unit time. Note
 that the throughput will always be less than or equal to the
 send rate due to losses. Finally, the number of non-duplicate
 packets received by the receiver in unit time gives us the
 goodput of the connection. The goodput is always less than or
 equal to the throughput, since the receiver may receive two
 copies of the same packet due to retransmissions by the
 sender. In a previous paper, we presented a simple model for
 predicting the steady state send rate of a bulk transfer TCP
 flow as a function of loss rate and round trip time. In this
 paper, we extend that work in two ways. First, we analyze the
 performance of bulk transfer TCP flows using more precise,
 stochastic analysis. Second, we build upon the previous
 analysis to provide both an approximate formula as well as a
 more accurate stochastic model for the steady state throughput
 of a bulk transfer TCP flow.},

 quantum chemical electrostatic potential (CHELP, CHELPG,
 Merz-Kollman, and RESP) have been compared and critically
 evaluated. It is shown that charges strongly depend on how and
 where the potential points are selected. Two alternative
 methods are suggested to avoid the arbitrariness in the
 point-selection schemes and van der Waals exclusion radii:
 CHELP-BOW, which also estimates the charges from the
 electrostatic potential, but with potential points that are
 Boltzmann-weighted after their occurrence in actual
 simulations using the energy function of the program in which
 the charges will be used, and CHELMO, which estimates the
 charges directly from the electrostatic multipole
 moments. Different criteria for the quality of the charges are
 discussed.},
