
Likewise, the objective of chapter 4 is to describe the researcher's design 
consideration when developing and testing the prototype. For an overview of 
the design of the prototype, the researchers considered different computer vision models in
 classifying the ripeness and bruises together with other algorithms to determine 
 the size of the mango. Likewise, the hardware design was also taken into consideration where 
 the physical design of the conveyor belt was taken into account.

\section{Introduction}
This chapter discusses the design considerations for the mango 
sorting and grading system, focusing on the technical and engineering decisions 
required for its development. The design process aims to create a scalable, efficient, 
and user-friendly system that leverages machine learning for accurate mango classification.

\section{System Architecture}
The system architecture is represented through a block diagram, showcasing modules such as image acquisition, 
preprocessing, feature extraction, machine learning model, and grading output. Each module is described in detail, 
emphasizing its role in the overall system. For instance, the image acquisition module uses high-resolution cameras 
to capture mango images, while the preprocessing module enhances image quality for better feature extraction.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{h_bridge_schematic}
	\caption{Hardware Schematic}
	\label{fig:h_bridge_fig}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:h_bridge_fig} presents the electronic circuit diagram,
designed using Proteus. The diagram illustrates a system where a Raspberry Pi 4
serves as the central control unit, managing four motors through a relay
mechanism. The Raspberry Pi 4, represented by a rectangular box on the left,
showcases various pin connections, including GPIO pins, power supply pins (5V
and 3V3), ground pins (GND), and communication pins (TXD, RXD, SDA, SCL).

In the center of the diagram, an 18-pin integrated circuit labeled "ULN2803A" is
depicted. This component, a Darlington transistor array, likely functions as a
buffer, providing the necessary current to drive the relays. Four relays,
designated as RL1, RL2, RL3, and RL4, are positioned on the right side of the
diagram, each connected to a motor (represented by a circle with an "M" inside)
and a +12V power source. Additionally, four resistors are placed between the
ULN2803A and the relays, serving to limit current. The circuit section
containing these resistors is labeled "4 Channel Relay Driver," indicating its
purpose.

The camera module is labeled "PICAMERA" is located in the top center of the
diagram. It is represented by a square with a circle inside, symbolizing the
camera lens. The camera module is connected to the Raspberry Pi 4 through the
CSI (Camera Serial Interface) pins. The overall circuit is designed for a 12V
system, with the +12V power supply indicated at various points. The Raspberry Pi
4's GPIO pins are used to control the relays.

\section{Hardware Considerations}
The hardware components include high-resolution cameras, lighting systems for consistent image capture, and 
microcontrollers like Raspberry Pi or Arduino for system control, actuators like DC and stepper motors to move 
the mangoes. The choice of hardware is justified based on cost, performance, and compatibility with the software framework.

\subsection{General Prototype Framework}
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{pro2typediagram}
	\caption{Prototype Framework}
	\label{fig:prototypeDiagram_fig}
\end{figure}

The Figure 4.2 presents the overall prototype layout of the automated Carabao
mango sorter and grader. The diagram illustrates the flow of operations from
mango loading onto the conveyor belt to sorting them. It illustrates the major
elements of the system, that is, the image acquisition area, lighting system,
camera module, Raspberry Pi controller, and mechanical actuators. The layout
illustrates how all the subsystems work together to ensure mangoes are scanned,
processed, sorted based on ripeness, size, and bruises, and eventually sorted
based on the calculated priority score. The layout served as the basis for
actual prototype development.



\subsection{Prototype Flowchart}
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{mainFlowchart}
	\caption{Prototype Main Flowchart}
	\label{fig:pro2typeDiagram_fig}
\end{figure}

The flowchart in Figure 4.3 represents the overall operational logic of the
mango grading and sorting system. The process starts with system initialization,
where the camera and lighting modules are switched on and the machine learning
algorithms are initialised. The input of the user priority values as well as the
detection of the mango on the conveyor belt triggers the capture of both the top
and bottom cheek of the mango. The captured image is processed using machine
learning algorithms to determine its ripeness, size, and bruises. Depending on
these classifications along with priority weights given by the user, the system
calculates an overall score. Once this calculation is done, the mango is routed
to the respective bin through the respective actuator. Having this logical
sequence is important to know the system's decision-making and automation
process.

Figure 4.4 shows the first 3D model of the initial physical prototype developed
for the sorting and grading system. This model shows the skeleton of the system
and where the conveyor system is going to be placed strategically in order to
flip the mango for image acquisition. It is useful for where the hardware
components would be arranged and assembled. This 3D model helped the researchers
visualize the spacing, alignment, and where to mount parts before assembling the
prototype making sure all electronic and mechanical components are effectively
integrated.
